2. UI has been set up and connected to the logical parser for further implementation, reserved buttons for upgrading
2. Parser has mostly complete and can cover all the potential user input occasions but need more improvements.
3. Graphing part can generate a 2D graph with user defined functions but need more improvements.
4. More testing should be added to cover all potential user input in order to identifies bugs.
