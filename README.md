# Scientific Calculator

### Project Description

Group project for COMP6442

Project Requirement: https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2100/assessments/02-project/

A scientific calculator is a type of advanced calculator designed to calculate problems in science, engineering, and mathematics.

## Scientific calculator

### Default features

+ Scientific keyboard support (e.g. trigonometric functions, log/exp functions, etc)
+ Parsing & execution equation with brackets e.g. (, {, [, ], }, )
+ Equation editing (i.e. after computing a certain equation, one can modify the computed equation and recompute the result)
+ Defining function (a defined function can be reused multiple times. i.e. define f(x,y) = 2x+3y then call f(1,2), f(2,3), â€¦)
+ Saving and loading functions (i.e. one can reload the saved functions after restarting the app)

### Advanced feature
+ Function plots: a calculator plots the functions defined by a user.
